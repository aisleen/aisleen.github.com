      <h2>Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        My project is focused on sustainability, creating a digital experience that encourages people to be conscious consumers. From the findings that I have gathered in my secondary research, there is an increase in companies that are focusing
        their efforts in becoming more sustainable, incorporating sustainable practices into their business models. Since 2014, sustainable product sales have grown up to 20% (Gelski). They enhance their customer loyalty and improve the market share,
        all while building a positive brand image. Some of the company's main focus includes reduced carbon footprint, biodegradability, and reusability. Clothing companies such as H&M and ASOS have created sustainable sourcing programs. They have
        integrated social, ethical, and environmental performance factors when selecting and building strong, long-term relationships with their suppliers. This benefits their customers because it assures greater safety in the use of their products,
        some not including harmful chemicals that can potentially lead to premature puberty in children, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders (Stuart). For eco-conscious consumers, the main categories that they research to ensure they are
        environmentally friendly are household cleaning products, personal care products, food, electronic devices, and clothes. Furthermore, the categories with the largest share of sustainable products are toilet tissue, milk, yogurt, coffee, and
        bottled juices. Sales of reusable coffee cups and water bottles increased. Plastic straws are banned in many bars and restaurants, while single-use plastic bags were banned within large retail stores, implementing a fee for recycled paper
        bags.
        Purchasing habits are also shifting. Overall, one in three consumers prefer eco-friendly options when purchasing products. On a survey conducted by Edelstein called “More consumers are opening their wallets for eco-friendly products,” 35% of
        the people are willing to spend more money on such products and 56% said they are slightly likely to do so (Stuart). 62% of eco-conscious consumers believe that eco-friendly products are better for their health. Nielsen found that 48% of U.S.
        consumers are willing to change their habits to reduce the impact on the environment (Gelski). Sustainable shoppers are more likely to be digitally engaged, having the products and knowledge they want right at their fingertips. Half of
        digital consumers say environmental concerns impact their purchasing decisions (Young). There is a brighter hope of the increase in conscious consumers as 72% of respondents in a study reported that they were actively buying more
        environmentally friendly products than they did five years ago (Martins). Moreover, 75% of millennials are altering their buying habits with the environment in mind (Mullen). They are more willing to pay more for products with ingredients
        that are sustainable, environmentally friendly, organic or natural, or socially responsible products. 74% said they find it easier to find environmentally friendly products in stores where they shop (Nielsen). Millennials are leading the way,
        driving the sustainable movement with their lifestyle and behavioral changes and becoming known as the Green Generation. On the other hand, 34% of baby boomers are altering their buying habits with the environment in mind (Nielsen). They show
        more brand loyalty, having a more challenging time finding environmentally friendly products when shopping. There is a generational divide in sustainability as it is fueled by technology. Digitalization plays a significant role in people’s
        purchasing decisions, as a seamless shopping experience between on and offline is critical.
